    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, the focus lies in the quest to improve the hosting experience on Airbnb, particularly in the city of Edinburgh. One challenge Airbnb hosts face is understanding what factors contribute to \n",
    "their Airbnb listing's star ratings, which significantly impact their bookings and revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to uncover valuable insights by analyzing review texts. Our primary goal is to predict average star ratings based on these reviews, providing hosts with actionable feedback on areas of improvement. By extracting key features from reviews, such as cleanliness, communication, and amenities, we can offer guidance to both new hosts seeking to establish themselves and experienced hosts looking to enhance their offerings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this analysis aims to empower hosts by providing useful insights and actionable recommendations to enhance their performance and maximize their ratings. Furthermore, we aim for these insights to not only benefit hosts in Edinburgh but also serve as valuable guidance for hosts in other cities facing similar challenges in the competitive Airbnb landscape."

       "33  [Entire home/apt|Private room|Shared room|Hotel]\\n\\nAll homes are grouped into the following three room types:\\n\\nEntire place\\nPrivate room\\nShared room\\nEntire place\\nEntire places are best if you're seeking a home away from home. With an entire place, you'll have the whole space to yourself. This usually includes a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a separate, dedicated entrance. Hosts should note in the description if they'll be on the property or not (ex: \"Host occupies first floor of the home\"), and provide further details on the listing.\\n\\nPrivate rooms\\nPrivate rooms are great for when you prefer a little privacy, and still value a local connection. When you book a private room, you'll have your own private room for sleeping and may share some spaces with others. You might need to walk through indoor spaces that another host or guest may occupy to get to your room.\\n\\nShared rooms\\nShared rooms are for when you don't mind sharing a space with others. When you book a shared room, you'll be sleeping in a space that is shared with others and share the entire space with other people. Shared rooms are popular among flexible travelers looking for new friends and budget-friendly stays.  \n",
